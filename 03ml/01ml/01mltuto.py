     "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data "
     "and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed."),
    
    ("Main Categories of ML", 
     "1. Supervised Learning:\n"
     "   - Learns from labeled data.\n"
     "   - Examples: spam detection, house price prediction.\n"
     "   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks.\n\n"
     "2. Unsupervised Learning:\n"
     "   - Learns from unlabeled data by identifying patterns.\n"
     "   - Examples: customer segmentation, anomaly detection.\n"
     "   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, DBSCAN.\n\n"
     "3. Semi-Supervised Learning:\n"
     "   - Uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.\n\n"
     "4. Reinforcement Learning:\n"
     "   - Learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback (reward/punishment).\n"

     "   - Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ².\n"
     "5. Cross-Validation: Split data multiple ways to check model robustness.\n"
     "6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Use Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model settings.\n"
     "7. Underfitting & Overfitting: Balance between too simple or too complex models.\n"
     "8. Ensemble Learning: Combine models for better performance (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking).\n"
